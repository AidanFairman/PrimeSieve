To run the demo mode, just double click the executable. This will find all primes from 1 - 1,000,000 on 4 threads.
To run a different limit and number of threads, run the executable from command prompt in the form:

Primes.exe [threads] [limit]

The list of primes is output to a text file called "outputText.txt" in the executable folder.
